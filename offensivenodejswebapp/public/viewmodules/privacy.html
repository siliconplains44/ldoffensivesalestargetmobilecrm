The types of personal information that we may ask you to provide could include:   e-mail address, location, occupation, interests, birth date, web address, bio, password for the site or other information that help us serve you better.

    We may collect information about your visit to our site. For example, we may use analytics tools to retrieve information from your browser, including the site you came from, the search engine(s) and the keywords you used to find our site, the pages you view within the site, your browser add-ons, and your browser’s width and height. Additionally, we collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every web site you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring web site addresses.

    In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Leopard Data, information collected through one Leopard Data service may be combined with information obtained through other Leopard Data services.
    Use of Your Information

    The information collected on our site will be used to operate the site and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized.

    In support of these uses, Leopard Data may use your information to provide you with more effective customer service, improve the site experience and any related Leopard Data products or services, perform statistical analysis, and make the site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the site to your particular preferences or interests.

    We may use your information to provide you with important information about the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications. Additionally, with your permission, we may send you information about other Leopard Data products and services.

    Leopard Data may hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as web site hosting, packaging, mailing, and delivering prizes, answering customer questions about products and services, and sending information about our products, special offers, and other new services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

    We may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Leopard Data or our customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the services; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Leopard Data employees, customers or the public. We may also disclose personal information as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.

    Information that is collected on the Site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Leopard Data or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. Leopard Data abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.

    Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal information you provide on the site will not be shared outside of Leopard Data and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission.

    Please be aware that this privacy statement and any choices you make on the site will not necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided to Leopard Data in the context of other, separately operated, Leopard Data products or services.
    Security of Your Information

    At Leopard Data, we are committed to the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, if we transmit sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
    Use of Cookies

    We may use cookies on this site to enable you to sign in to our services or to help personalize the site. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return to the web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site’s features that you customized.

    You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.
    Web Beacons

    Pages on this site may contain electronic images known as Web beacons – sometimes called single-pixel gifs – that may be used to assist in delivering cookies, to allow us to count users who have visited those pages, and to deliver co-branded services. We may also include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.

    Leopard Data may also employ web beacons from third parties in order to help us compile aggregated statistics and determine the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations of our sites.
    Changes to this Privacy Statement

    We may occasionally update this privacy statement. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect.
